## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code can be run with the Anaconda distribution of Python. Python 3 was used to do the analysis.
Python libraries:

    Pandas
    Numpy
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
    Scikit learn


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

As part of the Data Science Nanodegree Capstone project, I used Starbucks rewards mobile app data to answer the following interesting questions:

1. Which Starbucks offer works best on the mobile app?
2. Which customers should be targeted?
3. Build a machine learning model to predict whether an offer will be completed or not.


The full set of files related to this analysis are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces in the analysis.  

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook to show my analysis related to the above questions. The notebook contains exploratory analysis to answer these questions. Markdown cells and comments were used to show the thought process for the individual steps. 


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@roFAb/starbucks-capstone-project-337a2ae6a77a).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Starbucks for the data.
